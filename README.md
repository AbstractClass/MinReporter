A (prototype) tool to track clan members activity with other clan members.

Primary purpose is to query recent activities and the players in those activities to see if clan members are playing with their clan and how much.

Example functionality is provided with my own clan, the Box Canyon Guardians, simple provide a Bungie API key and run the script.
